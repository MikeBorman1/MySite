I still remember the day in late 2017 when I, an impressionable and naive 18-year-old, was seated in the dimly lit Cafeteria of the Guernsey Grammar School sixth form, surrounded by the chatter of my peers. I was absentmindedly munching away on my greasy sausage roll, lost in my own thoughts when I happened to open the Binance App I had installed the day before on a whim. My eyes lit up with scintillating excitement and intrigue. The £300 I had thrown haphazardly into LISK of the back of a friend's comment had turned into over £600. From that day, I was hooked, spending most of my waking hours fixated on my screen, attempting to digest every morsel of information I could on this new thing called ‘the Blockchain’. And I would go on, as many people did, to turn my small investment into the most money I had ever seen in a bank account. To then quite rightly lose it all on the subsequent crash, I had no business having that amount of money from making a few dumb clicks and needed to learn the harsh lesson of becoming enraptured by the intoxicating heights of achievement. Especially one that I really did not deserve.

However, monetary gain aside, this brief encounter with glory piqued my interest and set me down the path to where I am today. Cardano, the chain we all know and love, was first unleashed onto the market in September of that year. And even though my adolescent dopamine-seeking hype-chasing ape brain was all over the shiny, flashy coins of the day, I still remember thinking, “wow, they have really thought this one through”. And this realisation stayed with me and deepened over the years as I slowly began to follow the project more and more.
